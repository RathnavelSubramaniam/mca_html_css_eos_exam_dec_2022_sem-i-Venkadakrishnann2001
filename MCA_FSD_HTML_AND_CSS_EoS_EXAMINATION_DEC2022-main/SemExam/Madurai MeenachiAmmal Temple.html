				<p><b>It is believed that the temple was originally constructed in 6th century BC by the survivors of Kumari Kandam. Later in the 14th century, the temple was looted of its valuables by Sultanate Muslim Commander Malik Kafur. The temple was rebuilt in the 16th century, in accordance with the Shilpa Shastra by Vishwanatha Nayakar. The original layout of Vishwanatha Nayakar was expanded to the current structure by Thirumalai Nayakar.

                    There are several legends associated with Madurai Meenakshi Temple. Highlighting a few of them below:
                    
                    One legend says it that the Meenakshi temple was founded by Indra, Lord of the Devas (Angels), when he was on his pilgrimage to expiate for his misdeeds. He felt light-hearted and felt his burden lifting off from him when he neared a swayambu (self-manifested form) lingam at Madurai. Attributing this miracle to the presence of the Lingam, he built a temple for Lord Shiva. Answering his ardent prayers, Shiva blessed him and caused golden lotuses to appear in a nearby pool.
                    
                    Another legend states that Goddess Parvati appeared out of the holy fire during Putra Kameshti Yagam (sacrifice for childhood), performed by the 2nd Pandya King Malayadwaja Pandian and his queen Kanchanamalai. Yet another legend says that the Goddess had already given notice to Kanchanamalai in one of her previous births that she would have the divine blessing of mothering the Goddess.
                    
                    The girl who came out of the fire had three breasts. A divine voice pacified the king and the queen not to worry about the abnormality and added that the third breast would disappear after she meets her future husband. The King named the child Tadaatagai and made her the heir to his throne. She was taught all the 64 Sastras (field of science).
                    
                    During her coronation, she had to win over all the three worlds encompassing all the eight directions. Tadaatagai could easily defeat Satyaloka (Brahma’s Abode), Vaikunta (Vishnu’s Abode), Amaravati (Deva’s Abode) and also the Bhoodhaganas (Guardians) and Nandi (Sacred Bull) of Kailasha, Lord Shiva’s abode. But once she sighted Lord Shiva, she bowed her head out of shyness and her third breast disappeared. She then realized that Shiva was her ordained husband and she is none other than an incarnation of his consort Goddess Parvati.
                    
                    Both Lord Shiva and Tadaatagai returned to Madurai where their wedding was held, with Lord Vishnu presiding over the divine ceremony. This glorious event is celebrated every year in Madurai as “Chithirai Thiruvizha”, which was started by Thirumalai Nayakar during his ruling period.
