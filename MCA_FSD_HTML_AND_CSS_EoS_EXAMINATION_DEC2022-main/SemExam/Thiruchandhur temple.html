					<p>Thiruchendur Murugan Temple is a Temple situated in Tiruchendur, Tamil Nadu dated 2000 years back. The temple is one of the 6 Abodes of Lord Murugan and situated near the sea of Bay of Bengal where the other 5 temples are situated in Mountains.

				Veera Mahendrapuri was ruled by Surapadma, an asura, who was the son of Rishi Kashyaba. Since the sage focused on stringent meditations, his sons grew up as Asuras.
				
				However, Surapadma was a sincere devotee of Lord Shiva and he spent most of his time to meditate on his favorite deity.
				As a result of his determined adoration, Lord Shiva gave him a boon, according to which Surapadman could neither be killed nor be defeated by anybody in this world, except the offspring of Lord Shiva born without Shivaâ€™s unification with any woman.
				The Murugan temple at Tiruchendur was occupied by the Dutch East India company from 1646 to 1648, during the course of their war with the Portuguese. The local people tried to free their temple, with no success. The Dutch finally vacated the temple on orders from the Naik ruler. However, while leaving, they removed the sculpture depicting the 2 utsava murthis (this representation of the deities comes out only during Maasi and Aavani tirunal) which is made of an alloy named Shanmukhar, and took it with them. During their sea voyage, they encountered a strong storm and realised their mistake of stealing the murti.
